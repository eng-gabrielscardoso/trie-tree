# Trie tree in Golang

This repository is a collection of codes for implementing a Trie tree using the Go language for the purposes of the discipline Data Structures II - UFPA.

## Running codes

1. You must have the specific version of the Golang specified in the `go.mod` file or above.
2. You must run the codes manually (terminal), do not use VS Code extensio or shortcuts, just dirty your hand.
```shell
$ go run . 
or
$ go run *.go
```
3. You also could build the code and generate the binary that will run in your specific architecture and OS
```shell
$ go build
```
